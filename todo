Add support for non-input-consuming terminals

Clean up the code
	
	Use more descriptive variable names

	Fix the ugly parts of the State interface

		Inconsistency about what is set during construction and what is set
		later

		Inconsistency in the way "next" / "_next" is set

		The way Terminal avoids direct references to the user-defined terminal

			There should be a more idiomatic way to do this with Moose

			Perhaps weak references will work?

Figure out why count doesn't work if we avoid making a clone in the first
loop iteration.
