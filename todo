Add support for non-input-consuming terminals

	This will allow things like:

		Something that always matches and returns a special value to indicate
		what branch you went along

		An alternative that always matches to something else that might fail,
		so you can have a default return value for the failure case

Write documentation in POD

Clean up the code
	
	Use more descriptive variable names

	Fix the ugly parts of the State interface

		Inconsistency about what is set during construction and what is set
		later

		Inconsistency in the way "next" / "_next" is set

		The way Terminal avoids direct references to the user-defined terminal

			There should be a more idiomatic way to do this with Moose

			Perhaps weak references will work?

Figure out why count doesn't work if we avoid making a clone in the first
loop iteration.
