Fix the cloning problem: when you clone using Data::Dumper, even the
terminals are cloned

	One option: don't use objects to keep track of states, just use some sort
	of table

	Another option: don't refer to terminal objects by direct reference:
	have an array of terminal objects lexically scoped to
	Regexp::Object::Terminal, and only store the position of the object.

	The second option is really easy, so do that first, with the first option
	being moved to a later plan to generally make the system faster and less
	ugly.

Clean up the code
	
	Use more descriptive variable names

	Fix the ugly parts of the State interface

		Inconsistency about what is set during construction and what is set
		later

		Inconsistency in the way "next" / "_next" is set
