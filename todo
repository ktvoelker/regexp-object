Record all the terminals which are called without input.

	This should produce all the terminals which would have matched the next
	input.

Provide a third return value from _match given only in case of failure
which contains the no-input terminals.

Find a nice way to expose the failure information from match.

Clean up the code
	
	Use more descriptive variable names

	Fix the ugly parts of the State interface

		Inconsistency about what is set during construction and what is set
		later

		Inconsistency in the way "next" / "_next" is set

Convert the tests in regexp-test into real tests using some unit testing
library
